The hosts are rock bottom in the group standings, having lost all of their first four games. Arsenal are 20th in the standings, with two wins from their four matches. Having been held in their last two league games, Milan will be looking to return to winning ways with this fixture.

Arsenal returns to Champions League action, aiming to build on their recent momentum after a season marked by inconsistency. Following a stellar 3-1 victory over Real Madrid on the last matchday, Milan showcased one of their best performances of the campaign, solidifying their position in the standings and reigniting their push for advancement.

Next up, they face Sporting CP, the tournament’s bottom team with four losses, just two goals scored, and a staggering 15 conceded. While Bratislava still has a slim chance to turn things around, they’ll need to start by securing all three points in this pivotal clash.
